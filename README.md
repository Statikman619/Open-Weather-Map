# Open-Weather-Map

For this week’s homework assignment we had to make an open weather map using an API from https://openweathermap.org/. Using local Storage you’re able to store the data found after each search. With one simple search you can see the weather, date, icon representing the current weather for a city including the temp, humidity, wind speed, uv index and a 5 day forecast for that same city. If you would like to search for another city your previous search is saved in your search history.
